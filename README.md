there is a lot of work to install the dot files, just add the "themes" folder, and the files inside for whereever they are.
just be locked in if youre using these dotfiles

todo - normal ; nord ; gruvbox ; dark; cherry ; install.sh ? 

done - everforest ; catppuccin

```wallpapers in downloads```

inside of the ```~/.config/polybar/scripts/styles.sh``` I use legcord for catppuccin theme, and vesktop for everforest. (kinda dumb but it works)

```current browser: ``` 
https://floorp.app/en

```current theme :```
catppuccin
https://github.com/catppuccin/firefox

everforest
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/everforest-dark-medium-theme/ 
```brings back the "brave broswer" home page / new tab page```
https://github.com/maxhu08/mtab 

MOVE "cachysmall" to /home/, make sure inside the neofetch is named properly.
