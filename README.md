# i3-themes

there is a lot of work to install the dot files, just add the "themes" folder, and the files inside for whereever they are.
just be locked in if youre using these dotfiles

todo - install.sh ? 

**wallpapers in downloads**
inside of the ```~/.config/polybar/scripts/styles.sh``` I use legcord for catppuccin theme, and vesktop for everforest. (kinda dumb but it works)

# i3  medium
